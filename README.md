# 🔮 Next Word Predictor

Welcome to the **Next Word Predictor** repository! This project uses machine learning to predict the next word in a sentence, making text entry faster and smarter. 📖✨

## 🚀 Project Overview

This notebook provides an implementation of a **Next Word Predictor** model using deep learning techniques. This project is ideal for applications in **text editors**, **messaging apps**, and **language learning platforms** where predictive text can improve user experience.

### Key Features
- 🌟 **Predict the next word** in a sentence contextually.
- 🔍 **Trained on large datasets** to provide accurate predictions.
- 🧠 **Uses RNNs or LSTMs** to capture the sequence of words.
- 📈 **Scalable and adaptable** for different languages or domains.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Next_Word_Predictor.ipynb` - Main notebook containing the code for model training and prediction.
- `data/` - Directory containing the dataset used for training the model.
- `models/` - Directory for saving trained models.

## 📜 Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Next-Word-Predictor.git
   cd Next-Word-Predictor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open the `Next_Word_Predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and follow the cells step-by-step.

## 🔥 Usage

1. **Load the Model**  
   Run the cells to load the model and necessary libraries.

2. **Enter Text for Prediction**  
   Input a sentence, and the model will predict the most likely next word based on the given context.

3. **Example Usage**  
   ```
   Input: "I am going to the"
   Output: "store"
   ```

## 🛠️ Model Training

- The model is trained on a large corpus of text data, utilizing either **RNNs**, **LSTMs**, or **GRUs** to capture word dependencies.
- You can modify training parameters like batch size, epochs, and learning rate in the notebook to suit your dataset.
